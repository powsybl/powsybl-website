## Introduction

In this page the different network components are described in terms of electrotechnical representation.
Each component is identified through a unique ID, and optionally by a name that is easier to interpret for a human.
Note that the equipments in the IIDM model may be flagged as fictitious, in order to fine tune the network modelling.

### Voltage Level

**Characteristics**

| Attribute | Type | Unit | Required | Default value | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ---- | -------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Id | String | - | yes | - | The ID of the voltage level |
| Name | String | - | no | - | The name of the voltage level |
| NominalV | double | kV | yes | - | The nominal voltage |

<span style="color:red"> TODO: remove the Table.</span>

A voltage level in IIDM represents a set of equipments connected together with the same nominal voltage, physically close to each other (~ 1-100m).
Two voltage levels may be connected through a line (they are then located in different substations) or through transformers (they are then located within
the same substation).

A voltage level in IIDM comprises some metadata:
- a nominal voltage (in $$kV$$)
- a low voltage limit and a high voltage limit (in $$kV$$): they are both optional metadata. The voltage should always remain within these bounds, otherwise it means that the equipments will suffer extra wear compared to
their normal use
- a topology information: indicates whether the voltage level is described in [node/breaker]() or [bus/breaker]() view

#### Node/breaker topology
<span style="color:red"> TODO: explain the topology.</span>

In node/breaker topology, the voltage level is described with the finest level of detail. See the sketch below for an example.
<span style="color:red"> TODO: add sketch of voltage level.</span>
The topology is then described as a graph structure, where busbar sections, injections or branches are connected to the vertices.
When an equipment is connected to a vertex, in the IIDM descrition it corresponds to a `Terminal` object.
It is not possible to connect two equipments on the same vertex.
The edges are constituted of switches or internal connections. See the following sketch corresponding to the previous example:
<span style="color:red"> TODO: add sketch of voltage level topology graph.</span>


**Busbar section**  
A busbar section is a non impedant element used in a node/breaker substation topology to connect equipments.

**Switch**  
<span style="color:red"> TODO</span>

**Internal connection**  
An internal connection is a non-impedant connection between two components in a voltage level.

**Characteristics**

| Attribute | Type | Unit | Required | Default value | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ---- | -------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Id | String | - | yes | - | The ID of the busbar section |
| Name | String | - | no | - | The name of the busbar section |
| V | double | kV | no | - | The voltage magnitude of the busbar section |
| Angle | double | Â° |  no | - | The voltage angle of the busbar section |

<span style="color:red"> TODO: remove the Table</span>


#### Bus/breaker topology
In bus/breaker topology, the voltage level is described with a coarser level of detail. See the sketch below for an example.
<span style="color:red"> TODO: add sketch of voltage level in bus/breaker topology.</span>
The topology is then described as a graph structure, where the vertices are buses and the edges are switches.

**Bus**  
A bus is a set of equipments connected at the same voltage.
When an equipment is connected to a bus, in the IIDM descrition it corresponds to a `Terminal` object.
In IIDM there is thus one `Terminal` per connected equipment.

**Switch**  
<span style="color:red"> TODO: explain the difference with node/breaker switches</span>

### Injections

An injection in IIDM is any AC equipment with a single connection point to a voltage level.
Below are the different types of injections supported by PowSyBl.

#### Generator

A generator is an active equipment that injects active power, and injects or consumes reactive power. 
It may be controlled to hold a voltage or reactive setpoint somewhere in the network (not necessarily directly where it is connected).
More details about this behavior, which is called regulation, are available [here](#voltage-regulation).

    - `HYDRO`
    - `NUCLEAR`

    - `AUXILIARY`
    - `FICTITIOUS`

#### Battery

A battery on the electric grid is an energy storage device that is either capable of capturing energy from the grid or of injecting it into the grid. The electric energy on the grid side is thus transformed into chemical energy on the battery side and vice versa. The power flow is bidirectional and it is controlled via a power electronic converter.

#### Dangling Line

The IIDM network may be connected to other networks for which a full description is not available.
In this case, a boundary line exists between the two networks. In the IIDM model of the fully described network,
that connection is represented through a dangling line, which represents the part of that boundary line which is known.
A dangling line is thus a passive or active component that aggregates a line chunk and a constant power injection, in passive-sign convention.
The active and reactive power setpoints are fixed: the injection represents the power flow that would occur through the connection, were the other
network fully described.

#### Transformers

##### Three windings transformer

A three windings power transformer is connected to three voltage levels (side 1, side 2 and side 3) that belong to the
same substation. We usually have:

- Side 2 as the secondary side (side with the medium rated voltage)
- Side 3 as the tertiary side (side with the lowest rated voltage)

A three windings transformer is modeled with three legs, where every leg model is electrically equivalent to a two windings transformer.
For each leg, the network bus is at side 1 and the star bus is at side 2.

Two windings transformer are modeled with the following equivalent $$\pi$$ model:

![Power line model](./images/two-windings-transformer-model.svg){: width="50%" .center-image}

With the series impedance $$z$$ and the shunt admittance $$y$$ and the voltage ratio $$\rho$$ and the angle difference $$\alpha$$ and potentially parameters from the current step of a ratio tap changer and/or a phase tap changer, we have:

$$
\begin{align*}
    r=r_{nom}.\left(1+\frac{r_{r, tap} + r_{\phi, tap}}{100}\right)\\
    x=x_{nom}.\left(1+\frac{x_{r, tap} + x_{\phi, tap}}{100}\right)\\
    g=g_{nom}.\left(1+\frac{g_{r, tap} + g_{\phi, tap}}{100}\right)\\
    b=b_{nom}.\left(1+\frac{b_{r, tap} + b_{\phi, tap}}{100}\right)\\
    \rho=\frac{V_{2nom}}{V_{1nom}}.\rho_{r, tap}.\rho_{\phi, tap}\\
    \alpha=\alpha_{\phi, tap}\\
    z=r+j.x\\
    y=g+j.b\\
    V_{0}=V_{1}.\rho e^{j\alpha}\\
    I_{0}=\frac{I_{1}}{\rho e^{-j\alpha}}\\

An HVDC line is connected to the DC side of two HVDC converter stations.

**Characteristics**

| Attribute | Type | Unit | Required | Default value | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ---- | -------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Id | string | - | yes | - | Unique identifier of the HVDC line |
| Name | string | - | yes | - | Human-readable name of the HVDC line |
| R | double | $$\Omega\$$ | yes | - | The resistance of the HVDC line |
| ConvertersMode | `ConvertersMode`| - | yes | - | The converter's mode |
| NominalV | double | kV | yes | - | The nominal voltage |
| ActivePowerSetpoint | MW | double | yes | - | The active power setpoint |
| MaxP | double | MW | yes | - | The maximum active power |
| ConverterStationId1 | String | - | yes | - | The ID of the HVDC converter station connected on side 1 |
| ConverterStationId2 | String | - | yes | - | The ID of the HVDC converter station connected on side 2 |

**Specifications**

- The `ConvertersMode` can be:
    - SIDE_1_RECTIFIER_SIDE_2_INVERTER
    - SIDE_1_INVERTER_SIDE_2_RECTIFIER
- The active power setpoint and the maximum active power should always be positive values. The flow sign is given by the type of the converter station. Power always flows from rectifier converter station to inverter converter station. At a terminal on AC side, P and Q follow load sign convention. P is positive on rectifier side. P is negative at inverter side.

#### LCC Converter Station

**Characteristics**

| Attribute | Type | Unit | Required | Default value | Description |

| Id | string | - | yes | - | Unique identifier of the LCC converter station |
| Name | string | - | yes | - | Human-readable name of the LCC converter station |
| PowerFactor | float | - | yes | - | The power factor |

**Specifications**

- The PowerFactor is equal to
$$
\frac{P}{\sqrt{P^{2} + Q^{2}}}
$$
and should be between -1 and 1. Note that at terminal on AC side, Q is always positive: the converter station always consumes reactive power.


#### VSC Converter Station

**Characteristics**

| Attribute | Type | Unit | Required | Default value | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ---- | -------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| VoltageRegulatorOn | boolean | - | yes | - | The voltage regulator status |
