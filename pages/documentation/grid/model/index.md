### Injections

An injection in IIDM Grid model is any AC equipment with a single connection point to the network.
Below are the different types of injections supported by PowSyBl.

#### Battery

A battery on the electric grid is an energy storage device that is either capable of capturing energy from the grid or of injecting it into the grid. The electric energy on the grid side is thus transformed into chemical energy on the battery side and vice versa. The power flow is bidirectional and it is controlled via a power electronic converter.

#### Transformers

##### Three windings transformer

A three windings power transformer is connected to three voltage levels (side 1, side 2 and side 3) that belong to the
same substation. We usually have:
- Side 1 as the primary side (side with highest rated voltage)
- Side 2 as the secondary side (side with the medium rated voltage)
- Side 3 as the tertiary side (side with the lowest rated voltage)

A three windings transformer is modeled with three legs, where every leg model is electrically equivalent to a two windings transformer.
For each leg, the network bus is at side 1 and the star bus is at side 2.

![Power line model](./images/two-windings-transformer-model.svg){: width="50%" .center-image}

With the series impedance $$z$$ and the shunt admittance $$y$$ and the voltage ratio $$\rho$$ and the angle difference $$\alpha$$ and potentially parameters from the current step of a ratio tap changer and/or a phase tap changer, we have:

$$
\begin{align*}
    r=r_{nom}.\left(1+\frac{r_{r, tap} + r_{\phi, tap}}{100}\right)\\
    x=x_{nom}.\left(1+\frac{x_{r, tap} + x_{\phi, tap}}{100}\right)\\
    g=g_{nom}.\left(1+\frac{g_{r, tap} + g_{\phi, tap}}{100}\right)\\
    b=b_{nom}.\left(1+\frac{b_{r, tap} + b_{\phi, tap}}{100}\right)\\
    \rho=\frac{V_{2nom}}{V_{1nom}}.\rho_{r, tap}.\rho_{\phi, tap}\\
    \alpha=\alpha_{\phi, tap}\\
    z=r+j.x\\
    y=g+j.b\\
    V_{0}=V_{1}.\rho e^{j\alpha}\\
    I_{0}=\frac{I_{1}}{\rho e^{-j\alpha}}\\
\end{align*}

$$
\left(\begin{array}{c}

I_{2}
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
