If you encounter a problem with PowSyBl, the first places to ask for help are the user mailing list and the `#issues` [spectrum channel](https://spectrum.chat/powsybl/issues?tab=posts).

If, after having asked for help, you suspect that you have found a bug in PowSyBl, you should report it by opening an issue in the appropriate [GitHub repository](../documentation/developer/repositories/index.md). Before creating a bug report, please **perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Apowsybl)** to see if the problem has already been reported. Prefer to add a comment to an existing issue instead of opening a new one to avoid duplication and make it more complex the triage of issues.

If there is no already existing issue for your problem, feel free to create a new issue. Please provide as much details as you can on your problem filling the issue template, and don't forget to indicate which version of PowSyBl you are running and on which environment.
