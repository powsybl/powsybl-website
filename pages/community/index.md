## Getting and keeping in touch

### Mailing lists
Discussion and questions on PowSyBl's usage and development happens on the following mailing lists:
- [General](https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/powsybl): General mailing list for user questions and discussions. This is also where new releases are announced.
- [Developers](https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/powsybl-dev): Questions and discussions related to PowSyBl development.
- [Technical Steering Committee](https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/powsybl-tsc): Votes and decisions impacting the project organization or its technical direction.

### Spectrum
Our [spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/powsybl) is another place to discuss or ask questions on Powsybl's usage, if you suspect that you have found a bug in PowSyBl or if you would propose an enhancement.

### Slack
We have recently moved to the [Powsybl Slack](https://powsybl.slack.com) organization for all chat.

## Reporting bugs
If you encounter a problem with PowSyBl, the first places to ask for help are the user mailing list and the `#issues` [spectrum channel](https://spectrum.chat/powsybl/issues?tab=posts).

If, after having asked for help, you suspect that you have found a bug in PowSyBl, you should report it by opening an issue in the appropriate [GitHub repository](../documentation/developer/repositories/index.md). Before creating a bug report, please **perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Apowsybl)** to see if the problem has already been reported. Prefer to add a comment to an existing issue instead of opening a new one to avoid duplication and make it more complex the triage of issues.

If there is no already existing issue for your problem, feel free to create a new issue. Please provide as much details as you can on your problem filling the issue template, and don't forget to indicate which version of PowSyBl you are running and on which environment.
