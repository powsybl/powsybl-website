The `iTools` script provides a common way to interact with Powsybl, using the command line.

# Usage
```shell
itools
usage: itools [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]

Available options are:
    --config-name <CONFIG_NAME>   Override configuration file name

Available commands are:
...
```

## Options

### config-name
Use the `--config-name` parameter to set the configuration file's basename. This basename is used to find the configuration
file in the specified `iTools` configuration directory.

# Available commands
The `iTools` commands are discovered at runtime: depending of the jars present in the classpath, some commands could be
unavailable. The commands are classified in themes, to help identifying their purpose.
