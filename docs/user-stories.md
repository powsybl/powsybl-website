We advice you to start with our user stories in order to well understand the possibilities of the framework:

- [How to run a load flow with Powsybl ?](/user_stories/loadflow_tutorial.md)
- [How to calcultate capacity for a Regional Security Center ?](/user_stories/capacity_calculation_rsc.md)

We also propose some tutorials to learn how to extend Powsybl. As Powsybl is a plugin based Java framework, most features can be customized by creating a new implementation of a service or extended by a new extension. Read this [documentation](tutorials/index.md) page to learn more about how to extend the features of the framework.
