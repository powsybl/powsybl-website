The `load-flow-action-simulator` module is used by the [action-simulator](../../tools/action-simulator.md) tool if it's
configured to use the `LoadFlowActionSimulator` implementation.

# Properties

## copy-strategy
Use the `copy-strategy` to define how the action-simulator will store and restore network state internally. This choice
can greatly impact performances.
Possible values are:
- STATE: will only save and restore state data. Optimizes performances, but will not behave correctly if some actions
modify the structure of the network.
- DEEP: will save and restore all network data. Decreases performances, but allows to use any type of action.

## ignore-pre-contingency-violations
Set the `ignore-pre-contingency-violations` to `true` to ignore the pre-contingency violations and continue the
simulation even if there are still violations after the pre-contingency simulation.

## load-flow-factory
Use the `load-flow-factory` property to define the `com.powsybl.loadflow.LoadFlowFactory` implementation to use for the
simulation.

## max-iterations
Use the `max-iterations` parameter to limit the number of iteration needed to solve the violations.

# Examples

## YAML
```yaml
load-flow-action-simulator:
    copy-strategy: STATE
    debug: false
    ignore-pre-contingency-violations: false
    load-flow-factory: com.powsybl.loadflow.mock.LoadFlowFactoryMock
    max-iterations: 10
```

## XML
```xml
