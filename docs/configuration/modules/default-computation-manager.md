title: default-computation-manager
layout: default
---

The `default-computation-manager` module is an optional module loaded when an `iTools` command starts, to determine which
`com.powsybl.computation.ComputationManager` implementations should be used for short-time and long-time computations.
The choice of using the short-time or the long-time computation manager factory is done by the implementation of each
type of computations (e.g. load-flow, security-analysis...).

If this module is not set, the `com.powsybl.computation.local.LocalComputationManager` implementation is used. Read the
[computation-local](computation-local.md) page to learn how to configure the `LocalComputationManager`.

# Required properties

## short-time-execution-computation-manager-factory
The `short-time-execution-computation-manager-factory` property is a required property that defines the name of the
`com.powsybl.computation.ComputationManagerFactory` implementation to use for short-time computations.

# Optional properties

## long-time-execution-computation-manager-factory
The `long-time-execution-computation-manager-factory` property is an optional property that defines the name of the
`com.powsybl.computation.ComputationManagerFactory` implementation to use for long-time computations. If not defined,
this property returns the same value as the `short-time-execution-manager-factory`.

# Examples

## YAML
```yaml
default-computation-manager:
    long-time-execution-computation-manager-factory: com.powsybl.computation.local.LocalComputationManagerFactory
    short-time-execution-computation-manager-factory: com.powsybl.computation.local.LocalComputationManagerFactory
```

## XML
```xml
<default-computation-manager>
    <long-time-execution-computation-manager-factory>com.powsybl.computation.local.LocalComputationManagerFactory</long-time-execution-computation-manager-factory>
    <short-time-execution-computation-manager-factory>com.powsybl.computation.local.LocalComputationManagerFactory</short-time-execution-computation-manager-factory>
</default-computation-manager>
```
