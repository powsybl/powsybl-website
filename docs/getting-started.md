# Installation
There are two different ways to package an application based on powsybl framework.

The first one aims to create a command line bundle, based on `iTools` script, using the [itools-packager-maven-plugin](installation/itools-packager.md).

The second one aims to create a JavaFX desktop application based on the Grid Study Environment, using the
[javafx-packager](installation/javafx-packager.md) to create an installable bundle for Linux (rpm or deb), Windows (exe
or msi) or MacOS (pkg or dmg).

# Configuration
Most features of powsybl can be configured by editing the relative configuration's module in the configuration files.
Read this [documentation](configuration/modules/index.md) page to learn more about powsybl's configuration and have an
overview of all the existing modules.
