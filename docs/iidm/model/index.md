Powsybl's internal data model describes electrical networks via [a network core model](#network-core-model) which represents the network equipments
and its main attributes and [network extensions](#network-extensions) which can specify equipments' particular attributes for custom use cases.

# Network core model

The [Network](network.md) core modeling is made of two main objects: substations and lines. A substation can have several voltage levels and a line can be of several types (AC lines, DC lines and AC lines shared between two countries).

- [Line](line.md)

- [Tie line](tieLine.md)

- [HVDC line](hvdcLine.md)

- A [Substation](substation.md) can be made of several voltage levels, which are connected through transformers:

    - [Two windings transformer](twoWindingsTransformer.md)

    - [Three windings transformer](threeWindingsTransformer.md)

    - [VoltageLevel](voltageLevel.md)
        - [Node/Breaker topology](../../todo.md)
        - [Bus/Breaker topology](../../todo.md)
        - [Battery](battery.md)
        - [Generator](generator.md)
        - [Load](load.md)
        - [Shunt compensator](shuntCompensator.md)
        - [Dangling line](danglingLine.md)
        - [Static VAR compensator](staticVarCompensator.md)
        - [VSC converter station](vscConverterStation.md)
        - [LCC converter station](lccConverterStation.md)

The following image shows some elements of the internal data model:

# Network extensions

As explained above, network extensions can describe electrical equipments' attributes which are only useful for some
specific use cases (e.g. dynamic simulation, UCTE networks merging, etc.). The following extensions are provided by
Powsybl framework:

- ActivePowerControl for [generators](generator.md#active-power-control) and [batteries](battery.md#active-power-control)
- [CgmesConversionContextExtension](../../todo.md)
- [CgmesModelExtension](../../todo.md)
- [CoordinatedReactiveControl](../../todo.md)
- [Entsoe Area](../../todo.md)
- [MergedXnode](../../todo.md)
- [ThreeWindingsTransformerPhaseAngleClock](../../todo.md)
- [TwoWindingsTransformerPhaseAngleClock](../../todo.md)
- [Xnode](../../todo.md)

However, it is also possible to [create you own custom network extension for your need](../../todo.md).
