title: Loadflow
layout: default

The `com.powsybl.loadflow.LoadFlow` is the main entry point to run load-flow
computations. It provides the static methods `run` and `runAsync`. These methods
will run the computation and only differ in the way they return the results.
The `run` method returns the results directly and can be used in most cases.
The `runAsync` returns a `CompletableFuture` and can be used when a
non-blocking computation is prefered. The `LoadFlow` class doesn't implement
the computation directly, but instead relies on a
`com.powsybl.loadflow.LoadFlowProvider` to implement it. This allows to use
different load-flow algorithm implementations with the same code. Both the `run`
and `runAsync` use the globally configured load-flow provider. `LoadFlow` also
has a `find` method that allows to use a specific load-flow provider for this
computation.

**Note**: Powsybl provides a `com.powsybl.loadflow.mock.LoadFlowMock` that
does nothing. An external implementation is available: [hades2](http://rte-france.github.io/hades2/index.html).

# Configuration
See [Loadflow Configuration](../configuration/modules/load-flow.md) to configure the default load-flow.
