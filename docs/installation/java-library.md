Powsybl can be used as a plain Java library to develop your own application.
Depending on the features you wish to pick, you will select different Powsybl artifacts.
This page aims at listing them, summarizing their purpose and helping you figure out what you need in your 'pom.xml' file.
The Powsybl artifacts are available at Maven Central under the `com.powsybl` groupId: [Powsybl Artifacts](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/powsybl/).

To help you navigate in the list below, we used labels to tag the artifacts:

**User** corresponds to an artifact that may be used for your application, without any modification of Powsybl

**Advanced user** corresponds to an artifact aimed at helping you making first extensions of the Powsybl framework to better fit your needs

**Powsybl developer** corresponds to an artifact aimed at developers who contribute to the Powsybl framework more deeply
