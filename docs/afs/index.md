Powsybl provides several implementations of the storage API:
- an [implementation](afs-local.md) that exposes a local folder, in a read-only mode
- a MapDB based [implementation](afs-mapdb.md) that stores the data in a file.
- an [implementation](afs-remote.md) that exposes remote drives for client/server applications 

Read the [tutorial](../tutorials/afs/afs.md) to learn more about AFS.
